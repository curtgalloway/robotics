 Inertia and gravity load for Puma 560 robot (6 points possible)

A Puma 560 robot is moving from pose A to pose B and the respective joint angle configurations are given by the workspace variables qa and qb. A model of the robot is provided in the workspace variable p560.

Compute a joint interpolated trajectory of 100 steps between these two points. At each time step, for joint 2, determine the gravity torque acting on the joint and the inertia experienced by the joint.

Save the maximum magnitude joint 2 gravity torque in the workspace variable taug2max.

Compute the ratio of the maximum to minimum joint 2 inertia and save the result in the workspace variables I2ratio.
