 Analytic Jacobian (8 points possible)

Derive the analytic Jacobian that maps rates of change of ZYZ Euler angles to angular velocity. You may choose to do this using pen and paper, or use the MATLAB Symbolic Toolbox provided in the version of MATLAB distributed with the MOOC. As a cross-check on your answer we know that ZYZ Euler angles have a singularity when the middle angle is equal to zero, and this should correspond to the Jacobian being singular.

For the set of ZYZ Euler angles in the workspace variable eul compute the 3x3 analytic Jacobian matrix and place it in the workspace variable Je.

For an angular velocity given by the workspace variable omega determine the equivalent rate of change of Euler angles and return that in the workspace variable euldot.
