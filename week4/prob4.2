Consider the two-link planar revolute-prismatic robot arm shown above.

    The dimensions of the robot are given by the workspace variables a1 and a2.
    We wish to move the end-effector in a straight line from P0 to P1 which are given by the workspace variables P0 and P1. The motion will take 20 time steps each of 0.1 seconds. There are no limits on the possible values of the joint coordinates.
    Determine the joint coordinates at each step of the trajectory and save these as a 20x2 matrix in the workspace variable qtraj. The columns will correspond to joint 1 and joint 2 coordinates respectively, and the rows are the time steps from first to last.
