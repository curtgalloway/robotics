How to construct robot with prismatic joins

Hello!

#SerialLink

Some observations how to do it using toolkit.

L(1) = Link([0 0 1 0 0 pi/2]);
L(2) = Link([0 0 0 0 1 0]);
L(2).qlim = [0,5];
twolink = SerialLink(L, 'name', 'two link');
twolink.plotopt = {'workspace', [-5 5 -5 5 -5 5]};
%twolink.plot([0 1]);
twolink.teach();

Here's robot with Revolute (1) and Prismatic (2) joints.

dh parameters for joint:

[theta d a alpha type offset]

type - 0 for Revolute, 1 for Prismatic (optional if all your joints are Revolute).

offset - if you want "pre-rotate" Revolute joint (theta) or "pre-move" prismatic joint (d) (optional).

qlim is required for Prismatic joint if you would like to "plot" it or "teach" it.

plotopt 'workspace' option is required for SerialLink with Prismatic joints if you would like to "plot" of "teach" it.

workspace is x,y and z minimum/maximum axis limits for plotting robot using teach() or plot().
