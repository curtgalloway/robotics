 3D forward kinematics (5/5 points)

An antique Puma 560 robot manipulator, in excellent working order, is being installed in a factory.

The robot's base is at coordinate (17.4, 12.2, 1.3) metres with respect to the factory's coordinate system which has its x-axis pointing north-east and its z-axis pointing vertically upward. The robot's base coordinate frame has its x-axis pointing in the same direction as the factory's y-axis.

The robot is fitted with a tool, the end of which is (4.1, 0.3, 17.4) cm from the end of the robot expressed in the robot's end-effector coordinate frame.

The robot is moving along a trajectory from a set of joint angles q1 to q2, and these are provided for you in the MATLAB workspace in units of degrees. The trajectory takes 120 time steps to execute. Save the joint angle trajectory, in units of degrees, in a 120x6 matrix in the workspace called qt.

Compute the position of the end of the robot's tool with respect to the factory's coordinate system at time step 70 of the path and return this as a 1x3 vector in the workspace variable P70.
