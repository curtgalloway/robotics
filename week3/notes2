The first step is to determine rate of change of the rotation matrix 
        
		Rdot = skew(omega) * R

The next part of the problem requires us to approximately estimate the future value of the rotation matrix through rectangular integration
        
        R_T = R + 0.050 * Rdot;
        
but now the matrix R_T is not a proper orthogonal matrix so we need to normalise it
        
        R_T = trnorm(R_T);

To find the roll-pitch-yaw angles is simply
        
        RPY_T = tr2rpy(R_T,'deg')
        
and that's it!
