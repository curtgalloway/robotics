 Finding orientation from sensors (5/5 points)

A flying robot is equipped with a triaxial accelerometer, triaxial magnetometer and triaxial gyroscope. We wish to determine its attitude in 3D.

    At a particular point in time the readings of these sensors are given by the provided workspace variables a, b and omega respectively. Each of these is a 3-element vector corresponding to the sensor measurements in the x-, y- and z-directions.
    Some relevant local parameters are provided in the workspace: the local magnetic field strength B, the local magnetic inclination I in degrees, and the local gravitational acceleration g.
    Determine the roll, pitch and yaw of the robot and place the results, in units of degrees, in the workspace variables roll, pitch and yaw respectively.
