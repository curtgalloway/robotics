 Rotating a square (10/10 points)
2D coordinate system showing a rotated square

You are working on part of a 2D animation program and need to develop some code to rotate and display a shape.

    The corners (or vertices) of a square are given by the columns of the matrix V provided in the MATLAB workspace.
    Determine the coordinates of the corners of this square after rotation by the angle, in degrees, given by the workspace variable theta.
    Plot the square using the MATLAB plot function. Call the plot function four times, each time to draw one edge of the square. Do not add any other graphical items to the plot such as text or markers. The order in which you draw the lines does not matter, and nor does the color of the lines.
