 Redundant robot (5 points possible)

A model of a 20-joint robot whose end-effector moves in 3D space is provided in the workspace variable h3d. The robot is at a joint configuration given by the workspace variable q.

We wish the end effector to move with a Cartesian world-frame velocity given by the workspace variable V.

Determine the required joint angle velocity (in units of radians per second) to achieve this motion and place the result in the workspace variable qd.
