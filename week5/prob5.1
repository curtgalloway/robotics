 Transforming 3D velocity between frames (5/5 points)

Consider two coordinate frames {A} and {B}. The pose of {B} is defined relative to the world coordinate frame {A} by a relative pose given by the workspace variable T. With respect to the frame {A} the point P has a coordinate given by the workspace variable PA. The point is moving with respect to frame {B} with a translational velocity of VB. Determine the translational velocity of P with respect to the frame {A} and place the result in the workspace variable VA.
