 Under-actuated robot (5 points possible)

A model of a 4-joint robot is provided in the workspace variable px. The robot is at a joint configuration given by the workspace variable q.

We wish the end effector to move with a Cartesian world-frame velocity given by the workspace variable V. The robot is underactuated and therefore we know we cannot control the end-effector velocity in all Cartesian directions, we wish to control only vx,vy,vz,Ï‰y.

Determine the required joint angle velocity (in units of radians per second) required to achieve this motion and place the result in the workspace variable qd.
